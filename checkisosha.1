.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This manual page documents briefly the \fBcheckisosha\fR command.  \fBcheckisosha\fR is a program that checks an embedded SHA-256 or MD5 checksum in a ISO9660 image (.iso), or block device.  The checksum is embedded by either the \fBimplantisosha\fR or \fBimplantisomd5\fR command.  Both checksum types are supported for backward compatibility.
.PP
The check can be aborted by pressing Esc key.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"

Program returns exit status 0 if the checksum is correct, 1 if the checksum is incorrect or non-existent, or 2 if the check was aborted.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-\-md5sumonly\fP" 10
Do not check the target.  Instead, output human-readable information about the target's checksums.
.IP "\fB\-\-verbose\fP" 10
Display human-readable progress as the target is checked.  Without this option, nothing is outputted except errors.
.IP "\fB\-\-gauge\fP" 10
Display a series of numbers from 0 to 100, corresponding to check progress.  This output can be piped to \fBdialog \-\-gauge\fR for a user-friendly progress bar.
