isomd5sum provides a way of making use of the ISO9660 application data
area to store md5sum data about the iso.  This allows you to check the
iso given nothing more than the iso itself.

## Cross-Platform Support

isomd5sum now supports Windows in addition to Linux/Unix platforms:
- Check embedded MD5 hashes on ISO images and physical media on Windows
- Inject MD5 hashes into ISO images created on Windows
- Build native Windows executables (.exe)

See docs/WINDOWS_BUILD.md for Windows build instructions.

## Building

### Linux/Unix (using Makefile)
```bash
make
make install
```

### Cross-Platform (using CMake)
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
make install
```

For Windows builds, see docs/WINDOWS_BUILD.md for detailed instructions.
